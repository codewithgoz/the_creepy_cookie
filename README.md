This is just a fun project I developed for my webinar's students. 

The main idea is that:
* They practice CSS animations
* They practice vainilla JS
* They get info from a json file

I'll be adding more creepy messages in the near future.

You can use The Creepy Fortune Cookie code for your personal and commercial use just remember two things:

* Consider removing the font-awesome icon and instead use one of yours (the same with the cookie's images)
* Please share your creation with me :D
